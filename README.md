# 8051-I2I-Development-Board (8051 Microcontroller Board Evaluation):
Description:
#1.ADC Temprature sensor: We used LM35 as temprature sensor and we took data from that, displayed various temprature data and voltages using 16x2 lcd display.
#2.DIGITAL clock: We implemented clock using frequency of 11.0592Mhz and displayed hour,min & sec with AM/PM using 16x2 lcd display.
#3.EEPROM string: We passed a string in to EEPROM,its an I2c based program,we wrote and read acknowledgemets using that  and diplayed string in 16x2 lcd diplay.
#4.I2C based RTC: We implemented real time clock(RTC) using I2c protocol and displayed year,month,week & time using lcd 16x2 display.
#6.LCD 16x2 Display: We used 16x2 diplay and displayed a string in it.
#7.LED Blinking: We were used 8051 microcontroller(I2I boards),we toggled LEDs using set bit operations.
#8.SWITCH to Blink LED: We were used switches in 8051 board to blink the LED i.e, when we press the switch LED will glow.
